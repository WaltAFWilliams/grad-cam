All credit goes to Adrian Rosebrock at pyimagesearch for making his tutorial: [Grad-CAM: Visualize class activation maps with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/03/09/grad-cam-visualize-class-activation-maps-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/). I largely followed that tutorial when implenting this project.
